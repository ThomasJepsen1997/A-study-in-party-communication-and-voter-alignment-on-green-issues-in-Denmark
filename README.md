Do partisan voters follow? - A study in party communication and voter alignment on green issues in Denmark. We investigated this question using data crawling, unsupervised machine learning and fixed effects.

# Excerpt from the assignment

To examine our research question, we use social media data from Twitter and data from The Danish National Election Study (DNES) in 2015 and 2019. We got access to the data from Twitter by using the academic application programming interface (API). We collected tweet and retweet data from the official profiles of Danish political parties a year before the election in 2015 up until the post-election period for the 2019 election (08/06/2014 â€“ 31/12/2019) resulting in 72.243 tweets.

Below you can see the number of tweets made by danish political parties in the period 2014-06 to 2019-12:
